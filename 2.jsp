	<font color='black' size="+2">Cryptography is a method or technique by which a message can be altered so that it becomes meaningless to anyone else but the intended recipient.
	This is done primarily in two basic ways, one is to change the position of letters or words within a message known as <u><b>Transposition</b></u>
	and the other is by substituting letters or words by different ones, known as "Substitution" respectively. The word cryptography comes from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden and graphein, which means writing. Cryptography, the science of encrypting and decrypting information can be traced back all the way to year 2000 BC in Egypt.  
	<br/><b><u>Encryption/Enciphering - </b></u>The process of putting text into encoded form to make them unreadable and un-understandable to unauthorized user. 
	<br/><b><u>Decryption/Deciphering - </b></u>Any procedure used in cryptography to convert cipher text (encrypted data) into plaintext. 
	<br/><b><u>Key - </b></u>A relatively small amount of information that is used by an algorithm to customize the transformation of plaintext into cipher text (during encryption) or vice versa (during Decryption).
